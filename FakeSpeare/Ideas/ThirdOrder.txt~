Text would be much more coherent if FakeSpeare used third-order text:

This requires a 3-dimensional matrix
P(Xi=d|Xi-1=b,Xi-2=a)

Basically:  
- let wordA = "the", wordB = "dog", for each wordC "bites", "walks", "eats", etc., we now count how many times wordC occurs.
- After done counting, we convert the counts to frequencies.
- Once we have frequencies, we should cumulative-sum them, to get "buckets"

Also, use of the standard c++ library's Map class might allow smaller (8 or 16 bit) numbers.

This might allow much more data to be stored.

We need to be able to serialize this to the iPhone memory.

ParodyMatrix Class

Probably need to create a class to handle all operations on sparse dictionary

Matrix Creation:
- initialization (choose 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. order = dimensionality of matrix)
  also, choose precision

- insertion (create entry if non-existent, or increment value)
- conversion of column to frequency
- conversion of column to buckets (cumulative sum)

Getters/Setters:
- get value from key(s) input
- set value from key

I/O:
- parse file into unique word list
- create matrix from file
- serialization
- de-serialization

Math: (for fun)
- matrix mult?
- eigenvalues/vectors?

Text Creation:
- lookup (for text generation)
- text generation
